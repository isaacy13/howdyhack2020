automated password tester using selenium
(tested on custom website - isaacy13.pythonanywhere.com)
correct username: "test_user"
correct password: "bailey1"

note: "bailey1" was moved up on the test list for time's sake. you can experiment with your own passwords & usernames by making your own website! (I recommend www.pythonanywhere.com, especially with websites that run on Flask like mine!)

to run, make sure you have selenium and chromedriver installed
>> pip3 install selenium
>> pip3 install chromedriver

>> python automate_logins.py
