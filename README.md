# Automated Password List Checker

Howdy all!
Isaac here.
This is my first project published on github so forgive me if things don't work out of the box (or in general).

After 16 hours of Howdy Hack (and multitudes of axed ideas), my group and I have constructed an automated password checker. It runs via selenium and python!
Basically, the script tries the top 10,000 most common passwords to try to get into accounts.

Now, trying this on other peoples' websites is unethical so we made our own at isaacy13.pythonanywhere.com!

If you want to try making and hosting a flask website, the website files uploaded on this repo and when ready, you can host it at pythonanywhere.com for free!

Anyways, that's all. Simple as it is, we just wanted to put SOMETHING out for HowdyHack 2020!

Instructions for how to use the script or run a local website are in the README.md's of their respective folders!

Thanks!
